# Simple-Sudoku-Algorithms
Simple sudoku algorithms which are intended to be coding practice for new languages.
Pencil: Solves via the pencil method, aka finding possibilities for each square and narrowing them down over time.  Compared to a brute force solution this is much quicker but less flexible as the algorithm is unable to guess, leading to incomplete solutions.
