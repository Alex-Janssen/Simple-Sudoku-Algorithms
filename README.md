# Simple-Sudoku-Algorithms
Simple sudoku algorithms which are intended to be coding practice for new languages.  A brief description of the algorithms follows:

Pencil: Solves via the pencil method,  finding possibilities for each square and narrowing them down over time.  Compared to a brute force solution this is much quicker but less flexible as the algorithm is unable to guess, leading to incomplete solutions.
